= Introduction =

Please date stamp anything you want to change in here because it makes it easier but as it's mostly just me sorting this out it's more of a reminder to myself.  So, the plan was to switch over to the new 1.7.4 Framework and change the layout of the classes a bit to the new ways I have learned.

= Goals =

  * DB Classes in different files
  * Models only contain function to do with that model
  * Use the layout system
  * Use the Zend Forms
  * Rework any piece of code necessary that is currently too complex
  * Keep it Simple!

= Next =

  * Make Login work properly so things start talking to the Auth object
  * Use the Auth object to submit recipes

= Complete =

Below is a list of what I believe are complete parts of the re-work, feel free to test.
