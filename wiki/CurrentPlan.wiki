#summary Beware the mythical plan, it exists.
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Please date stamp anything you want to change in here because it makes it easier but as it's mostly just me sorting this out it's more of a reminder to myself.  So, the plan was to switch over to the new 1.7.4 Framework and change the layout of the classes a bit to the new ways I have learned.

= Goals =

  * DB Classes in different files
  * Models only contain function to do with that model
  * Rework any piece of code necessary that is currently too complex
  * Keep it Simple!

= Next =

  * Ratings
   * Add Rating, check counter is increased
  * Comments
   * Re-test comments (unsure if its broke
  * Tags
   * Add/Delete/Update
  * Search
   * By Name, Ingredient, Tag
  * Redirect
   * Redirect on 404 to a 404
   * Redirect to another page if no acl
   * Redirect on login if not logged in and they asked for a specific page

= Complete =

Below is a list of what I believe are complete parts of the re-work, feel free to test.

  * Make Login work properly so things start talking to the Auth object
  * Use the Auth object to submit recipes
  * Use the layout system
  * Use the Zend Forms
  * Implement an ACL, essential reading : http://codeutopia.net/blog/?s=ACL
  * Optionally show edit on recipe if user is owner
  * Only allow owner to edit recipe
