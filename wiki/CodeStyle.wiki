#summary A rough guide to coding style for this project.

= Guidelines =

At time of writing I am sure that not all the files adhere to these rules but I will try to make any new files added to to the project and any current files convert over to the following guidelines

== PHP Guidelines ==

    * Indents are tabs not spaces
    * Indents are set to 4 (for my editor)
    * Use standard PHPdoc formatting for commenting functions e.g.
{{{
/**
 * Text to decribe stuff here
 * @param $var Type Description
 * @return
 */
}}}

== HTML Guidelines ==

    * HTML id attributes should use hyphens
    * HTML name attributes should use undescores 
    * NEVER have an id attribute called the same as a name attribute
